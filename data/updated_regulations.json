These regulations establish minimum capital ratios that banks must maintain, including CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital thresholds. Capital buffers are applied as additional layers of safety. The Capital Conservation Buffer ensures that banks build up capital during non-stress periods, while the Countercyclical Buffer adjusts to economic cycles. Systemic Risk Buffers are applied to institutions whose failure could disrupt the broader economy. Moreover, supervisory authorities evaluate capital adequacy through the SREP (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process), tailoring requirements based on individual banksâ€™ risk profiles. Internal capital adequacy assessment processes (ICAAP) are expected to be robust, well-documented, and subject to scrutiny.",

Without explicit reference to Shariah principles such as prohibition of riba (interest), gharar (excessive uncertainty), or ensuring that capital components are free from non-Shariah compliant elements, it is not possible to fully confirm compliance.

The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), on the other hand, promotes a stable funding profile over the medium term. Beyond regulatory ratios, banks are expected to have comprehensive liquidity risk management frameworks.

Contingency funding plans and stress testing must be based on Shariah-compliant scenarios, avoiding reliance on conventional interest-based instruments. Governance of liquidity decisions shall ensure adherence to Shariah principles, including supervision by qualified Shariah boards. Institutions may engage in partnerships (Sharikah) and other Islamic contracts to enhance liquidity, ensuring profit and loss sharing and risk distribution according to Shariah standards.
