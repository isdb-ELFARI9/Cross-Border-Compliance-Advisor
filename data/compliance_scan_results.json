      "text": "The Basel III regulatory framework is implemented in the EU primarily through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV). These regulations establish minimum capital ratios that banks must maintain, including CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital thresholds. Capital buffers are applied as additional layers of safety. The Capital Conservation Buffer ensures that banks build up capital during non-stress periods, while the Countercyclical Buffer adjusts to economic cycles. Systemic Risk Buffers are applied to institutions whose failure could disrupt the broader economy. Moreover, supervisory authorities evaluate capital adequacy through the SREP (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process), tailoring requirements based on individual banks’ risk profiles. Internal capital adequacy assessment processes (ICAAP) are expected to be robust, well-documented, and subject to scrutiny.",
      "compliance_status": "partially_compliant",
      "justification": "The Basel III framework as described focuses on regulatory capital adequacy, buffers, and supervisory review processes, which are essential for financial stability but do not inherently address Shariah compliance requirements such as prohibition of riba (interest), gharar (excessive uncertainty), or ensuring transactions are based on permissible contracts. Since the provided summary of AAOIFI Shariah Standards is empty, there is no direct evidence that the Basel III capital rules incorporate Shariah principles or address the unique requirements of Islamic finance. Therefore, while the Basel III framework supports sound financial risk management, it lacks explicit Shariah compliance features and cannot be deemed fully compliant with AAOIFI standards without further adaptation.",

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) mandates that institutions maintain enough high-quality liquid assets to survive a 30-day stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), on the other hand, promotes a stable funding profile over the medium term. Beyond regulatory ratios, banks are expected to have comprehensive liquidity risk management frameworks. These include contingency funding plans, stress testing scenarios for both institution-specific and market-wide disruptions, and robust governance for liquidity decisions. The ECB regularly reviews these mechanisms through targeted reviews and data submissions.",

Without explicit incorporation of Shariah-compliant liquidity management practices or mention of adherence to AAOIFI SS, the rule cannot be considered compliant.

Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is required for higher-risk customers, particularly Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), cross-border relationships, or unusual transaction patterns. Institutions use AI and rule-based monitoring systems to flag suspicious transactions and submit Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs).
