  "final_answer": "The compliance risks associated with current liquidity policies can stem from inadequacies in the Risk Management Framework and Compliance & Ethics sections. These risks could include potential violations of Shariah principles in liquidity management practices, non-compliance with regulatory requirements in liquidity risk management, and ethical concerns related to transparency and disclosure of liquidity positions. It is crucial to address these issues to ensure that the liquidity policies align with Shariah principles, adhere to regulatory standards, and maintain ethical integrity in managing liquidity risks."
